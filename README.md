# Phorest-Challenge
I created a command line interface for the Phorest API. The code prompts the user to decide whether they want to search for a client by phone number or email by inputting either a or b. The user is then asked to input the phone number or email. The clients list is ordered by phone number/email and a binary search is performed to find the appropriate client. Once found, the clients individual ID is returned. The user is then asked to enter the amount that the clients voucher will be worth. Using the clients ID and the voucher value, a new voucher is added to the list of vouchers.
